# Vaccination Management System

A Java Spring Boot backend for managing vaccination records, appointments, vaccine batches, and citizen profiles — modeled after private vaccination chains (VNVC-style).

## Tech Stack

| Layer | Technology |
|---|---|
| Language | Java 21 |
| Framework | Spring Boot 4.0.6 |
| Security | Spring Security + JWT |
| ORM | Spring Data JPA + Hibernate |
| Database | SQL Server |
| AI | Anthropic Claude API (Citizen Advisor) |
| Build Tool | Maven |
| Deploy | Railway / Render |

## Key Features

**Core Domain**
- Role-based authentication: `CITIZEN`, `MEDICAL_STAFF`, `FACILITY_ADMIN`
- Vaccine catalog with multi-dose schedule support (variable intervals between doses)
- Disease catalog with ICD-10 codes, linked to vaccines via many-to-many
- Manufacturer & Supplier management with full supply chain traceability
- Facility management with versioned daily capacity (Optimistic Locking on `FacilityCapacity`)
- Vaccine batch tracking: inventory control, batch recall workflow
- Appointment booking with automatic dose interval validation and real-time slot availability
- Appointment status history audit trail (every status change logged)
- Vaccination record management: direct recording, retrospective entry, invalidation
- Vaccination reaction tracking per record (MILD / MODERATE / SEVERE), with report source distinction (staff-observed vs. citizen self-report)
- Immutable vaccination records for legal compliance — correction creates a replacement record, never overwrites
- Administrative unit hierarchy: 2 levels (PROVINCE / WARD) per Vietnam's 2026 reform

**AI Advisor**
- Citizen-facing conversational advisor powered by Anthropic Claude
- Agentic loop: Claude calls internal tools (`get_vaccination_history`, `get_recommended_schedule`, `get_available_slots`) via Anthropic Tool Use
- Provider-agnostic `LlmClient` interface — swap provider via a single config line
- Multi-turn conversation with in-memory session history and windowing (last 6 messages)
- Prompt caching on system prompt + tool definitions to reduce token cost
- FAQ short-circuit: 15 common vaccination questions answered from cache without calling the LLM
- 2-layer guardrail: system prompt constraints + keyword filter post-processing

## Quick Start

1. **Clone the project**
   ```bash
   git clone <your-repository-url>

   ```bash
   mvn spring-boot:run
   ```

4. **Run tests**
   ```bash
   mvn test
   ```

}
```

## Design Highlights

**Immutable vaccination records** — no UPDATE or DELETE on clinical data. Correction creates a new record with `replaces_record_id` pointing to the original; the original is set to `INVALID` in the same transaction.

**Optimistic Locking on `FacilityCapacity`** — `@Version` is placed on `FacilityCapacity`, not on `Facility`, so concurrent booking transactions don't contend on master facility data. Conflict returns HTTP 409.

**Vaccine dose schedules as first-class data** — `VaccineDoseSchedule` table replaces `requiredDoses`/`daysBetweenDoses` flat fields, enabling schedules with unequal intervals between doses (e.g., Engerix-B: 30 days between dose 1–2, 150 days between dose 2–3).

**3NF normalization** — `Manufacturer` and `Supplier` are separate entities, enabling independent supply chain traceability. `Disease` with ICD-10 codes is decoupled from `Vaccine`.

**Provider-agnostic AI layer** — `LlmClient` interface abstracts the LLM provider. Swap from Anthropic to any other provider by changing one config line; `CitizenAdvisorService` has zero imports from the Anthropic SDK.

**FAQ short-circuit** — 15 common vaccination questions are answered from an in-memory keyword cache before the agentic loop is invoked, eliminating unnecessary API calls for predictable queries.

**Guard Clause pattern** — every Service method validates exhaustively before the happy path: fail fast, no nested if-else.

**2-level administrative units** — PROVINCE and WARD only, reflecting Vietnam's administrative reform effective May 2026.

## Development Workflow

- Branch strategy: `main` → `feat/<feature-name>`
- Conventional Commits
- Strict layer separation: Controller → Service → Repository (no cross-layer imports)
- Run `mvn test` before every merge; all tests must pass
